Features
Multiple Scheduling Algorithms:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (SJF)

Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)

Priority Scheduling

Round Robin (RR)

Interactive GUI with real-time visualization

Customizable parameters for processes (arrival time, burst time, priority)

Time quantum adjustment for Round Robin scheduling

Gantt chart visualization of the scheduling sequence

Performance metrics calculation (waiting time, turnaround time)

Requirements
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or later

(For development) JDK 8 or later

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/pardhu1407/Interactive-Process-Scheduler-Simulator.git

bash
cd Interactive-Process-Scheduler-Simulator
Compile the Java files (if needed):

bash
javac *.java
Run the application:

bash
java Main
Usage
Launch the application

Select a scheduling algorithm from the dropdown menu

Add processes with their respective parameters:

Process ID

Arrival Time

Burst Time

Priority (if applicable)

For Round Robin, set the time quantum

Click "Calculate" to run the simulation
